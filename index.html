  ReLine Autocomplete - Full-line Autocomplete for JS and TS
  <br /><br />
  <img src="images/reline1.gif" style="max-width: 600px" />
  <br/><br />
  ReLine is an auto-complete provider that allows you to auto-complete lines using any text you've
  already written in this project.
  <br /><br />
  ReLine is in active development and this initial release only supports JavaScript and TypeScript projects (jsx/tsx
  enabled too).
  <br /><br />
  ReLine is not smart. It's more like a Copy+Paste helper than a true auto-complete solution. If you want smart,
  look for one of the great AI-powered auto-complete solutions on the VSCode Marketplace.
  <br /><br />
  Another way to think of ReLine is it's like an automatic snippet manager. All of the lines you've written before in
  this project become mini-snippets that you can access just by starting to type them.
  <br /><br />

  <h3>Features</h3>
  ReLine will attempt to complete the *full* line you're currently typing, if
  any exact matches (by prefix) are found in your codebase elsewhere.
  <br /><br />
  Reference code you've written elsewhere:
  <br /><br />
  <img src="images/example1.png" style="max-width: 600px" />
  <br /><br />
  Quick access to previously used literals:
  <br /><br />
  <img src="images/example4.png" style="max-width: 600px" />
  <br /><br />
  Easily repeat yourself on your most-used snippets:
  <br /><br />
  <img src="images/example3.png" style="max-width: 600px" />
  <br /><br />
  Your next line is waiting for you:
  <br /><br />
  <img src="images/example5.png" style="max-width: 600px" />
  <br /><br />

  <h3>Code Analysis</h3>
  Run the command "ReLine: Analyze workspace code" to get a peek at
  the size and duplication in your codebase.

    <b>What is going on here?</b>
    <p>
      This site is a placeholder to provide a landing page for ReLine. CodeNeedle is a domain I happened to have
      and it seemed to fit the idea of ReLine well. I put this site together in a few minutes to share the relevant
      info.

  <div>
    <b>Why would I use ReLine?</b>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>ReLine provides powerful autocomplete if you find yourself rewriting the same line frequently.</li>
      <li>It is easier to use than copy & paste (and doesn't pollute your clipboard).</li>
      <li>It's like having "Find All" directly where you're typing, if you know what you're looking for.</li>
      <li>It can make it easy to find and reference commonly used constants while writing CSS.</li>
      <li>You might find it easier to choose a mostly-correct autocomplete option and modify it as needed than typing it
        all out.</li>
    </ul>
